# es6_starter
Starter kit features:

- Gulp 4

- Is 'React friendly', compiling jsx into js files
- Uses ES6 default Module loader
- Script vendors are loaded directly from package.json

## Intro
...

## TODO
- Write about how everything works, options, etc...

## Gulp 4
This starter uses Gulp 4, but if you don't want to install Gulp 4 CLI globally, you can simply run:

``` $ npm install # to install all dependencies ```

and use

``` $ npm run gulp {task-name} ```

to run Gulp with your local devDependency, so you don't have to install it globally.

TODO: (better explain how to do this) If you do want to install Gulp 4 globally... you may need to 'sudo' these commands.

``` $ npm uninstall -g gulp ```
``` $ npm install -g gulpjs/gulp.git#4.0 ```
